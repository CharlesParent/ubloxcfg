- Move common (duplicate) code from data windows to base class (clear controls, epoch store and age calc and display)
- Implement A-GNSS
- Propagate UBX-INF-{ERROR,WARNING} (and maybe NOTICE, too?) to receiver input window log (or perhaps auto-open inf msgs window?)
- Record a UBX-INF-TEST message at the beginning of a log (with date, cfggui version, port, etc.)
